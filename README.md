## How to Live Stream to YouTube Using Streaming Software

**To start live streaming to YouTube using Streamlabs Desktop, perform the following steps:**

Step 1: Download Streamlabs Desktop.
Step 2: Connect Your Account and sign in with your YouTube credentials.
Step 3: After logging in, you can choose to import your settings if you already have your stream set up on other streaming software like OBS Studio or Xsplit.
Step 4: Add Your Microphone and Webcam. If you already have a webcam and a microphone connected to your computer, Streamlabs Desktop will automatically detect it here. Pick the devices you’d like to use, or you can change these devices later on.
Step 5: Add an overlay theme. There are over 250 free themes and many premium themes made by top designers in the industry. Theme overlay packages make your stream stand out and add a professional-looking touch.
Step 6: Choose your scene in the software. Here you can see the various scenes that came pre-packaged with the theme you choose. In this case, our theme is called “Nexus”.
Step 7: Add sources to your scenes. A source is something that outputs to the stream. A webcam is a source. One of the many widgets, such as a donation goal, can be a source. Capturing what’s on your screen is also a source.
Step 8: Click “Go Live” and input your stream information. You can customize the title and description of your stream on this page, pick the category you want to stream to, upload a custom thumbnail, and even share your stream on Twitter.
Step 9: After you’ve finished your first live stream, you will want to check the stats, how many tips you received, and viewers you had. Head to Streamlabs.com and log in to view the Streamlabs Dashboard. The dashboard is your one-stop shop to see your live streaming analytics, recent events, and latest features.
